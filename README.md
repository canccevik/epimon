## Overview

Epimon is a cryptocurrency blockchain simulation designed for developers who want to understand, test, and enhance the fundamental principles of blockchain technology.

Epimon comprises five main projects, each focusing on different feature sets. Below is a brief description of each project:

1. [**Blockchain**](https://github.com/canccevik/epimon/tree/main/apps/blockchain): This project is the backbone of the Epimon, handling essential blockchain operations. It verifies transactions for integrity and plays a key role in creating new blocks within the blockchain.
2. [**Node**](https://github.com/canccevik/epimon/tree/main/apps/node): Essential in preserving blockchain integrity, nodes verify and secure the network while mining blocks. Through this process, miners not only validate transactions but also earn EPM coins, ensuring the stability and immutability of the blockchain.
3. [**Episcan Web**](https://github.com/canccevik/epimon/tree/main/apps/episcan-web): This project empowers users to explore transactions, blocks, and wallet addresses within the blockchain seamlessly. It provides a user-friendly interface for in-depth examination of the blockchain network, allowing users to track various activities on the blockchain.
4. [**Episcan API**](https://github.com/canccevik/epimon/tree/main/apps/episcan-api): Developed specifically for the Episcan project, this API integrates with the main blockchain API to provide essential functionalities.
5. [**Wallet**](https://github.com/canccevik/epimon/tree/main/apps/wallet): This is a Chrome extension project that lets you do transactions, check your wallet balance, and more on the blockchain.

The combination of these projects gives users a practical understanding of how blockchains operate. Epimon is an open-source project and welcomes contributions from developers.
